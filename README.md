# ipv64-updater

This docker image connects to ipv64 using curl to update your DDNS IP, just use the compose.yaml. <br>
You need to change DUK/DUDs and you need to decide if you want to enable IPv4/IPv6. <br>
Note: no support for subdomains (prefix/pr√§fix) if you need it please either use CNAMS or create an issue and tell me why you need it
